KURRIKANE 1.0


Overview :

The main idea came when I started a new science game in KSP. I was looking for a way to get surface sample and reports from kerbin faster. The answer was in aircraft but I had to land, reports,take off, land etc... so I thought about a probe which is loaded on an aircraft (1-6 probes) and that would be dropped around kerbin biomes and then to takes the data and be recovered in the space center.


-------------------------------

What it does ?

It is basically a probe that can collect surface sample and do EVA reports without a kerbal. It's only purpose is on Kerbin usage

-------------------------------


HOW TO INSTALL :
1. Extract "Kurricane" into your "Kerbal Space Program\GameData" file
2. Enjoy

------------------------------


# HOW TO USE :

/!\ The probe must be on a radial decoupler to be properly ejected /!\
1- Add 1 or more probe on your ship/aircraft with decoupler
2- Add mk1 parachute on each probe you have
3- Properly arrange your stage so you can activate the chute and eject at the same time
4- Profit !

Bonus - You can do the "Rename Vessel" option on the beginning of your mission to make sure it will be consider as a probe/ship/lander/whatever you want and not be destroyed because it is a debris.
